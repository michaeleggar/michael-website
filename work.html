          DuctWorx is a custom ducting company based in Oklahoma City. They
          needed a website that could showcase their new branding and highlight
          their fabrication capabilities, while also being easy for
          non-technical staff to update after launch. </p>
        <p class="ruled-dashed">I designed the site to
          align with their recently established brand identity, then built it
          using reusable custom sections in Elementor on WordPress so the client
          could manage content on their own going forward.</p>
