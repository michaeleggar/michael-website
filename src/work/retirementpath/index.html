        <p class="ruled-dashed">
          Retirement Investment Advisors is a fiduciary firm based in Oklahoma
          City. Their existing site wasn't keeping up with how they actually
          served clients. They needed a redesign that could organize a growing
          library of resources, financial tools, and market commentary, all
          managed by staff with no technical background.

        <h3>Taxonomy system</h3>
        <p class="ruled-dashed">
          I built a resource library using custom post types and taxonomy-driven
          fields through ACF. New content gets tagged and featured across the
          site automatically. Their financial briefs and market commentary work
          the same way. Staff add content and the rest is handled for them.
        </p>
        <h3>Reusable content</h3>
        <p class="ruled-dashed">
          Same approach as the resource library at a page level. I created
          custom sections so their team can build and update pages on their own
          without needing a developer.
        </p>
        <h3>Visual refresh</h3>
        <p class="ruled-dashed">
          Their branding elements have held steady for nearly a decade, but they
          were ready for a refresh in how they're applied. I kept the classic
          navy and gold but opened things up with warm photography, more white
          space, and a refreshed type system.
